->	"push_value" en cours (algo 100),

->	i need to figure out how to push 1 closest value at a time

->	figured out how to push 1 value at a time, 
	but cursed error happends always at 5th PUSH B for some reason

->	cursed error is being fixed, problem is that I only RA but no RRA

->	error seems fixed (idk), i should start with sort_stb.c

->	we doin sort_stb now, doesnt seem to work right now but shouldnt be that complicated


->	i gotta fix the newcode, find how to properly manage the last chunk,
	wether it's an exact one (% = 0) or non exact one
