->	"push_value" en cours (algo 100),

->	i need to figure out how to push 1 closest value at a time

->	figured out how to push 1 value at a time, 
	but cursed error happends always at 5th PUSH B for some reason

->	cursed error is being fixed, problem is that I only RA but no RRA

->	error seems fixed (idk), i should start with sort_stb.c

->	we doin sort_stb now, doesnt seem to work right now but shouldnt be that complicated


->	i gotta fix the newcode, find how to properly manage the last chunk,
	wether it's an exact one (% = 0) or non exact one

->	chunks work now properly

--------

->	need to merge functions in main.c to put them in utils.c

->	i need to figure out how read, GNL & stdin works to properly do the checker (checker.c)

	|->	something is missing to make the checker work with the stdout of push_swap program.
		also need to make a exit_program function for the checker to close itself when the
		stack is succesfully sorted

---------

->	i'm currently optimizing the algo, i need to check 2 values to push
	at the same time, they must be the 2 higher ones


	for i in {0..99}; do ARG=`ruby -e "puts (0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG | tee >(wc -l) | ./checker $ARG; done
